Vega Build Packs
====================

Contents
--------

A build pack contains several third-party dependencies that are needed to 
build Vega.

Currently the following items are included:

  buildpack/target

	The Eclipse RCP SDK and RCP delta pack.

  buildpack/org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder

	The Eclipse build system.

Each build pack is versioned with the date that it was published using the
date format MMDDYYYY in the filname of the archive.  Inside the unpacked
archive an empty file exists at buildpack/version/MMDDYYYY which identifies
the buildpack version which is currently unpacked to the build system.


Creating a new Build Pack
-------------------------

A new build pack can be created with the master build script by specifying the
ant target 'buildpack-create'

  $ ant buildpack-create

This will create a new buildpack archive from the current contents of the
build/buildpack directory.  

  1) The empty version file (build/buildpack/version/MMDDYYYY) will 
     automatically be created.

  2) The contents of build/buildpack will be placed in a compressed 
     tarball in the build/archives directory as buildpack-MMDDYYYY.tar.bz2

  3) The sha-1 hash value of the new buildpack tarball will be calculated 
     and stored in buildpack-MMDDYYYY.tar.bz2.SHA

The sha-1 file must be committed into the git repository and the new buildpack
archive should be uploaded to the subgraph webserver so that it is available
to be downloaded by the build system when needed.

To use the new buildpack in a build a property must be changed near the top of
the master build file.  This property is called buildpack.version and should be
changed to the MMDDYYYY version value of the newly created buildpack.

Once the buildpack is available in the buildpack directory on the subgraph
webserver, the build script will automatically fetch the file, verify the checksum,
and unpack it into the build/buildpack directory when performing a build which
requires the new version.
