<title>Flash Cross-Domain Wildcard Allow-Access-From Domain </title>

<class>Information</class>
<severity>High</severity>
<discussion>
Vega has detected that the resource has specified an insecure Flash cross-domain policy. The crossdomain.xml file has set the domain attribute for allow-access-from to a wildcard value. This means that there are no domain-based restrictions on cross-site requests. The affected resource will accept cross-site requests originating from any domain. If the affected cross-domain policy is the master policy for the whole domain then there will be no domain-based restrictions for any resources within the entire domain.
</discussion>
        <remediation>
          Set a cross-domain policy that accepts requests only from specific trusted domains.
