	<discussion>
	Vega has determined that content from a client-specified location is being retrieved by the server and output. In some circumstances, code included in this content will be executed by the server. If this is possible, an attacker may be able to gain unauthorized access to the server. Minimally, the inclusion of content originating on a third-party server introduces the possibility of phishing or social engineering attacks.
