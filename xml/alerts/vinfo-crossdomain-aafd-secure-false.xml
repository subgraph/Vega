<title>Flash Cross-Domain Allow-Access-From Secure Flag False </title>

<class>Information</class>
<severity>Low</severity>
<discussion>
Vega has detected that the resource has specified an insecure Flash cross-domain policy. The crossdomain.xml file has set the allow-Access-from secure attribute to "false". This will permit HTTPS-based resources to accept cross-domain requests over unencrypted HTTP. This will eliminate any security benefits gained from using HTTPS, potentially facilitating man-in-the-middle attacks or eavesdropping of sensitive information.

        <remediation>
          Set the secure attribute to "true" in the allow-access-from configuration setting of the policy file.
